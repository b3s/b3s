# Sugar [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elektronaut/sugar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elektronaut/sugar) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/elektronaut/sugar/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/elektronaut/sugar) [![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/elektronaut/sugar/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/elektronaut/sugar)

Sugar is a modern open-source forum optimized for performance and usability,
written in Ruby on Rails.

## Dependencies

* [Ruby 1.9+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
* [Redis](http://redis.io/)
* [Java](http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp)
* libmagic

SQLite is supported, but you probably want
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) or [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) for
production use.

## Installation

If you want to hack on Sugar, the easiest way to get up and running is with
[sugar-dev-box](https://github.com/elektronaut/sugar-dev-box). It provides a
virtual development environment, and only requires VirtualBox and Vagrant.

Otherwise:

    $ git clone https://github.com/elektronaut/sugar.git
    $ cd sugar
    $ bundle
    $ rake db:create
    $ rake db:migrate

This assumes you have MySQL running on localhost, with a user named `rails`
with no password. See [Configuring Sugar](#configuration) if your setup
differs.

Now you can start Solr and the development server:

    $ sunspot-solr start
    $ bundle exec rails server

Sugar is now running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## Deploying Sugar

Sugar is deployed like a regular Rails app, see the
[official Rails site](http://rubyonrails.org/deploy). A sample Capistrano
recipe is provided `config/deploy.rb.dist`.

For production use, you'll want a full grown Solr setup. See the
[Sunspot documentation](https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot) for guides on how
to get up and running.

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is currently not supported, but will be
soon.

## <a id="configuration"></a> Configuring Sugar

Most of Sugar is configured with a web interface. However, a few details must
be sorted out before the app starts. The defaults should be fine for
development, but you need tweak these settings for production use with
environment variables.

Environment variable  | Required | Info
----------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SUGAR_SECRET_KEY_BASE | Yes      | Set to a long, random string
SUGAR_SECRET_TOKEN    | -        | Use if you are upgrading from Rails 3
SUGAR_SESSION_KEY     | -        | Default: `_sugar_session`
SUGAR_DB              | -        | Database backend. Default: `mysql`, also valid: `postgresql`, `sqlite`
SUGAR_DB_DATABASE     | -        | Default: `sugar_<%= Rails.env %>`
SUGAR_DB_HOST         | -        | Default: `localhost`
SUGAR_DB_USERNAME     | -        | Default: `rails`
SUGAR_DB_PASSWORD     | -        | Default: `rails` for PostgreSQL, blank for MySQL
