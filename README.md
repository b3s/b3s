# B3S

B3S is a modern open-source forum optimized for performance and usability,
written in Ruby on Rails.

## Dependencies

* [Ruby 2.0+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
* [Java](http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp)
* libmagic
* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)

## <a id="configuration"></a> Configuring B3S

Most of the application is configured with a web interface. However, a few 
details must be sorted out before the app starts. The defaults should be 
fine for development, but you need tweak these settings for production use 
with environment variables.

Environment variable  | Required | Info
----------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------
DATABASE_URL          | -        | URL to Postgres
